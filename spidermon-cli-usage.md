This gist is my way to think ahead what the usage of the CLI for Spidermon should be

With this gist I intend to be able to detect requirements and to have a good planning for the CLI implementation.

The CLI for Spidermon is a project for the GSoC 2019.


# help

```
$ spidermon help
```
This would be automatically generated by the usage of click library, and is part of documentation process.

# monitors

```
$ spidermon setup monitors
$ This is the list of monitors for the Basic Scrapy Suite
[1] Item Count
[2] Error Count
[3] Finish Reasons
[4] Unwanted HTTP Codes
Which monitor do you want to configure and enable? [1-4]: 1
$ How much items is the minimum to be notified?: 6
$ Do you want to configure and enable any more monitors?: y
$ This is the list of monitors for the Basic Scrapy Suite
[1] Item Count
[2] Error Count
[3] Finish Reasons
[4] Unwanted HTTP Codes
Which monitor do you want to configure and enable? [1-4]: 2
$ How much errors is the minimum to be notified? [default=0]: 10
$ Do you want to configure and enable any more monitors?: n
You have your monitors configured now! You're good to go.
```

An alternate approach would be:
```
$ spidermon setup monitors
$ Do you want to setup the Item Count Monitor [Y/n]: y
$ How much items is the minimum to be notified?: 6
$ Do you want to enable the Error Count Monitor [Y/n]: y
$ How much errors is the minimum to be notified? [default=0]: 10
$ Do you want to enable the Finish Reason Monitor [Y/n]: y
$ Which finish reasons do you want to track to be notified [default=finished]: finished error foo 
$ Do you want to enable the Unwanted HTTP Codes Monitor [Y/n]: y
$ Define a code to the first list of codes: 40
$ Which HTTP codes do you want to track under the code {40}: 403 404
$ Do you want to add any more list of codes [Y/n]: y
$ Define a code to the second list of codes: 50
$ Which HTTP codes do you want to track under the code {50}: 500 501 503
$ Do you want to add any more list of codes [Y/n]: n
Thanks for enabling the Basic Scrapy Suite! You have configured built-in monitor(s) now.
